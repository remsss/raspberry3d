<h1>Raspberry 3D</h1>

This is a simple website which runs on a pi4 with raspberrypi os.
The pi is connected to my creality cr-10 using USB cable as well as the camera which is a playstation eye.

I used simple htlm/css and js for the front end. 
The backend is written in python and the Flask module.

For the printing part I use printrun by <a href="https://www.pronterface.com/">pronterface</a>.
